# Password Generator

This is my solution to a solo project at Scrimba [JavaScript course](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnjavascript). I built this project from scratch and added more functionalities than what was asked such as copy-on-click, optional symbols, and determining password length. Hope you guys like it! üôåüèº

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- Pure CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

I occurred many difficulties throughout the project, including:
- Configuring the copy-on-click button: I was displaying the password in a `<p>` element and Clipboard API kind of only welcomes `<input>` & `<textarea>`. It took me a while to understand this and set everything again.
- I wanted to display the characters array in another file and import it in the **index.js** file. But that didn't turn out well because in order to do that, your js file should be of type **module**; and when I set the type, the `onclick()` event caused me problems. I tried to use `.addEventListener` to fix the problem, but then another issue happened in the copyOnClick() where the caught error stated that "Document is not focused!"

Overall, I really enjoyed my time working on this project. It made me realize a simple-looking task can become pretty complex when you try to add more functionalities to it.
